## Setup

Install dependencies:

[Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) to generate static docs website.

```bash
npm run build
```

npm run build:test
```

The docs is generated from /src/content/docs directory.

```bash
npm run dev
```

It runs docs in development enviroment by default. To run test version run:

```bash
npm run dev:test
```

## Linting

Linting of TypeScript files is provided by [ESLint](eslint.org) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint). In addition, [lit-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lit-analyzer) is used to type-check and lint lit-html templates with the same engine and rules as lit-plugin.

The rules are mostly the recommended rules from each project, but some have been turned off to make LitElement usage easier. The recommended rules are pretty strict, so you may want to relax them by editing `.eslintrc.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

To lint the project run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for code formatting. It has been pre-configured according to the Lit's style. You can change this in `.prettierrc.json`.

Prettier has not been configured to run when committing files, but this can be added with Husky and and `pretty-quick`. See the [prettier.io](https://prettier.io/) site for instructions.
