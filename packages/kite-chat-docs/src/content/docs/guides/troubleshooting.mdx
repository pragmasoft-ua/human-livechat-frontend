#### Rendered text is shifted downwards when using Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS sets the display property of the <Tag name="img"/> tag to display: block; during preflight. 
This introduces a line-break below the element which is not seen in the UI render. 
But, when you convert the same HTML to Image using html2canvas, the line-break gets rendered thus adding an unnecessary space in the resulting image. 
To solve this, we can add the following code to the tailwind.css file.

```css
@layer base {
    img {
        @apply inline-block;
    }
}
```

The above piece of code should be added after the @tailwind base; line.

#### CSS property render icorrectly

Some CSS features might be not supported yet. Relevant information at [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/features#unsupported-css-properties).
